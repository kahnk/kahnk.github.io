	<h6>ABOUT ME</h6>
	<p>
I graduated with a degree in English from Bates College in 2007 and dove head first into the Boston start-up scene at Gazelle in 2008, steering their operations for four years. During that time, I was fortunate to receive opportunities key to driving substantial growth (or what my direct superior called "functional promiscuity"). Today, I am -- more than ever -- committed to the belief that my true north is growth, and I am ecstatic to be learning technical marketing skills and best practices directly from successful marketers who wield them day in and day out.</p>
<h4> Where do you draw your inspiration from?<h4>
	<p>I draw inspiration from those like my father (who is North Korean defector), people who overcame exceptional odds to be where there are today. Their life stories keep me grounded (despite my millennial generation-ism); I am reminded that resting my ego on my laurels is and will always be unacceptable.</p> 

<p>From fiction, I am inspired by Captain Kirk of Star Trek. Like me, he doesn't believe in "no-win scenarios," a stubbornness that is more resilience than reckless gambling addiction. Kirk's comically taut relationship with Spock also speaks to me, i.e., seek out and do amazing things with those vastly different from you.</p>
